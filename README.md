## More on theme

Ashby BART splits colors and some text variables into their own objects within a separate `constants.js` file for easier experimentation. Font-families and weights are defined within the Typography theme object. The fonts used in the Ashby BART theme are "Quicksand" for headers and "EB Garamond" for body-text. Both are available from the https://fonts.google.com CDN.
